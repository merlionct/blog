This is the first post! 

I am still wading through new developments in web design world. When I started on the internet, people were make websites were called webmasters and blogs didn't exist. The last time I have tried to seriously create a website from scratch was in the late 90s (in secondary school), using HTML, Javascript, CSS and notepad editor. 

Now, I am older, have a day job,  and a bit slower :), so everything is going to be under construction for quite some time until I make sense of all these things.
